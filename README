Minbar is a GNOME Islamic prayer times application on top of libitl,
the Arabeyes prayer calculation library.

It runs in background as a tray icon, plays the 'athan' (call to
prayer) and notifies when at prayer times.

Minbar uses the following optional calculation methods:

You must adjust it to make it use the method you follow in Preferences.

BUILDING
--------

You need a few libraries and programs to build from source, on debian/ubuntu
these are:

automake1.9
gettext
gnome-common
libglib2.0-dev
libgtk2.0-dev
libglade2-dev
libitl-dev

There is already a binary package for GNU/Debian Linux and
Debian-derived distributions.

If you prepared a package for another Linux distribution or ported
