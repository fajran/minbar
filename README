This is a Gnome prayer times application on top of libitl, with 
athan sound playback and notifications etc.

It is still in the works.

To build, you need:
libglade
libitl
libgtk
gconf 
gsteamer-0.10

the build file builds the program. It works on my system, you may 
have to modify it for yours.

When you go to your distribution's package instllation mechanism
to get the needed libraries, make sure you fetch the development
files
